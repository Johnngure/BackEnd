Created by Johnwngure, this To Do List application was made using Django and Sqlite for the back-end. HTML, CSS and Python. Even its status is production, this app has only an educational purpose, so please do not share any personal information while using it.

Note: if the page takes a few seconds to response, it is normal, since I am using the free version of Heroku. Data loss may be a consequence of it too.

Functionalities

Logged users or anonymous users can create, update and delete their tasks (logged users by storing and accessing their information on database, and anonymous users storing and accessing their information by cookies).
